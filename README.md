# Memory-Card-Game

During my [Frontend Nanodegree Course from Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqs2G_rWq3wIVA8AYCh1nPg4mEAAYASAAEgLGYPD_BwE)
I developed a browser based version of the Memory Card Game (also known as
Concentration). The concept of the game is to find all pairs of cards that
exist on the board - the tricky part is that you're only allowed to see two
cards at once from the cards that are left. You have to memorize where which card lies
on the board in order to get a good rating.
